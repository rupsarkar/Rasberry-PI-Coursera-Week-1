In your own words, write a short paragraph describing the differences between the TCP and IP protocols.

IP protocols means Internet protocols. There are currently two implementations of this layer - IPv4 and IPv6, although the vast majority of the internet still uses IPv4. IPv4 is 32 bit memory. IPv4 uses one address format, and IPV6 uses a different one. IP protocols is an unreliable communication and host naming.
On the other side, TCP means Transmission Control Protocols. The TCP layer takes care of ensuring that there is a reliable channel for the application layer. The service it provides is connection based. TCP protocols communicate with process-to-process in application.

Then, in your own words, describe the different roles between the TCP and IP protocols in Internet communication.

TCP Protocols:
Process-to-Process communication
Reliable communication
Process naming

IP Protocols:
Host-to-Host Connection
Unreliable communication
Host naming scheme
